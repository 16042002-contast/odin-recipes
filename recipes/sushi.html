    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 package pre cooked brown rice</li>
        <li>2 sheets nori (dry seaweed)</li>
        <li>bamboo mat</li>
        <li>1 cucumber</li>
        <li>1 carrot</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place cooked rice in a microwave-safe bowl and cover partially. Microwave on high until hot, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Place 1 nori sheet on the bamboo mat. Spread 1/2 of the rice evenly on nori sheet, using a little water on your hands or a spoon to keep rice <br> from sticking. Place 1/2 of the cucumber and carrot slices on the top half of the rice, and roll nori sheet around rice and veggies, using the bamboo <br> mat to help. Repeat with remaining nori sheet, rice, and veggies.</li>
        <li>Cut each roll into 6 small pieces and put them in the refrigerator until cool, about 20 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
